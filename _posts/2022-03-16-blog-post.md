#### Reconnaissance
First I checked for open ports using a basic nmap scan
```bash
nmap -t4 <TargetIP>
  PORT      STATE    SERVICE
  80/tcp    open     http
  135/tcp   open     msrpc
  139/tcp   open     netbios-ssn
  443/tcp   open     https
  445/tcp   open     microsoft-ds
  512/tcp   filtered exec
  1152/tcp  filtered winpoplanmess
  1875/tcp  filtered westell-stats
  3306/tcp  open     mysql
  4662/tcp  filtered edonkey
  7741/tcp  filtered scriptview
  8080/tcp  open     http-proxy
  9010/tcp  filtered sdr
  20005/tcp filtered btx
  26214/tcp filtered unknown
  27000/tcp filtered flexlm0
  49152/tcp open     unknown
  49153/tcp open     unknown
  49154/tcp open     unknown
  49158/tcp open     unknown
  49159/tcp open     unknown
  49160/tcp open     unknown
```
I could see some HTTP open ports and decided to see what was accessible
```
http://<TargetIP>:8080/
	http://<TargetIP>:8080/oscommerce-2.3.4/catalog/
```
I could determine the framework being used for the commerce page was oscommerce-2.3.4. Using this information I visited Exploit-DB to see what was available.

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
