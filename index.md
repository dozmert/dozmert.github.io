# Security-Labs
This is my offensive security blog/repo thatâ€™s very much a work in progress meant for students and beginners. Write-ups are nothing new however, Iâ€™m aiming to reinforce what I have learned by trying to explain it to others. I will mainly look to grasp on to fundamentals and industry tricks rather than show off fancy techniques. As this blog/repo matures it will look diffrent from when it first started.

## TryHackMe
I have based most of my document on a general concept of the intrusion kill-chain:
Reconnaissance > Weaponization > Delivery > Exploitation > Installation > Command & Control > Actions on Objective

This is my offensive security blog that's very much a work in progress meant for students and beginners. Write-ups are nothing new however, I'm aiming to reinforce what I have learned by trying to explain it to others. I will mainly look to grasp onto fundamentals and industry tricks rather than show off fancy techniques. Furhter down the line I may look to overhaul the format and presentation of my posts however a fancy page is not my priority.

UPDATE: This blog is transitioning into a pure github repo. Additional content can be found [here](https://github.com/dozmert/Security-Labs).
